<h2>Installation</h2>

<p><strong>How can I install GBA4iOS?</strong> <br />
Unlike other apps for iOS, you can not install GBA4iOS from the App Store. Until GBA4iOS 2.0 is released, you can download version 1.6 from <a href="http://iemulators.com">iEmulators</a>, run by <a href="http://twitter.com/start3rs">Start3rs</a>, an awesome group of people who are beta testing GBA4iOS 2.0. To install, open the link on your iOS device, and follow the instructions at the top of the page.</p>

<p><strong>When will GBA4iOS 2.0 be released?</strong> <br />
When it's complete. I have no estimate, except soon. GBA4iOS is very close to completion, but the distribution method has a few kinks to work out to make sure it will work with iOS 7.1.</p>

<p><strong>What devices are supported?</strong> <br />
GBA4iOS 2.0: Any iOS device running iOS 7 or higher, optimized for iPad <br />
GBA4iOS 1.6: Any iOS device running iOS 6 or higher, letterboxed on iPads</p>

<p><strong>Does 7.1 break GBA4iOS?</strong> <br />
No. There have been enhanced security measures put in place by Apple to prevent downloading of unsafe software, but a fix for this will be in place when 2.0 is released.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p><strong>How do I add games to GBA4iOS?</strong> <br />
There are four ways to add games to GBA4iOS:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>GBA4iOS 2.0 only: Tap the plus button in the top right corner of the main screen to launch the in-app web browser. Open the ROM website of your choice, then find the game you want to download. Begin the download, and it'll automatically appear for you to play when it's done.  </p></li>
<li><p>GBA4iOS 1.6 only: Tap the search button in the top right corner of the main screen to launch Safari. Open the ROM website of your choice, then find the game you want to download. Begin the download, and wait until it completes (on iOS 7, Safari doesn't display a progress bar, so be patient!). Once it's downloaded, tap either "Open in GBA4iOS..." or "Open in..." and tap GBA4iOS, and it'll then open GBA4iOS with the game ready for you to play.</p></li>
<li><p>Open Safari on your iOS device, go to the ROM website of your choice, then find the game you want to download. Begin the download, and wait until it completes (on iOS 7, Safari doesn't display a progress bar, so be patient!). Once it's downloaded, tap either "Open in GBA4iOS..." or "Open in..." and tap GBA4iOS, and it'll then open GBA4iOS with the game ready for you to play.</p></li>
<li><p>Download the game you want from any ROM website on your computer. Open iTunes with your iOS device plugged in, then click on your device in the top right corner. Click "Apps" at the top of the screen, then scroll to down to the "File Sharing" section. Click GBA4iOS, then drag in the games you want to play.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How do I delete games from GBA4iOS?</strong> <br />
Simply swipe to the left on the game you want to delete, then confirm with the dialogue that pops up. Any data you have related to that game in Dropbox will <em>not</em> be deleted.</p>

<p><strong>What types of games are supported?</strong> <br />
GBA4iOS 2.0: Full support for Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games <br />
GBA4iOS 1.6: Full support for Game Boy Advance games</p>

<p><strong>Can I transfer saves files between my device and computer?</strong> <br />
Yes, but only save files (.sav), <em>not</em> save states or cheats. Open iTunes with your iOS device plugged in, then click on your device in the top right corner. Click "Apps" at the top of the screen, then scroll to down to the "File Sharing" section. Click GBA4iOS, and now you can drag saves in or out.</p>

<p><strong>If I delete GBA4iOS, will I lose my data?</strong> <br />
Yes. If it no longer opens, copy your ROMs and save files to your computer so they are not lost, then you can try reinstalling the app and dragging your data back in. However, even if you do delete the app from your phone, your data in Dropbox will be safe.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>General Features</h2>

<p><strong>How can I enable Fast Forward?</strong> <br />
While playing a game, tap the Menu button, then tap "Fast Forward". Or, if you have an iOS 7 controller connected to your device, you can configure one of the buttons to fast forward whenever it is held down. (Not supported on iPhone 4 or iPod touch 4th Gen)</p>

<p><strong>How do I sustain a button?</strong> <br />
While playing a game, tap the Menu button, then tap "Sustain Button". Or, if you have an iOS 7 controller connected to your device, you can configure one of the buttons to enter sustain button mode whenever it is held down. Once you have done this, either tap the button you want to remain pressed, or press anywhere there isn't a button to cancel or un-sustain a previously sustained button.</p>

<p><strong>Can I link two devices with GBA4iOS running over wifi/bluetooth so I can trade Pokemon/battle/whatever else requires two GBAs?</strong> <br />
Not yet, but you can transfer the saves to your computer and link them together using a program such as <a href="http://www.vbalink.info">VBA-Link</a>.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>Save States</h2>

<p><strong>How can I save a save state?</strong> <br />
While playing a game, tap the Menu button, then tap "Save State". From the menu that appears, you can select a General save state to overwrite it, or tap the plus button in the top left to create a new save state.</p>

<p><strong>How can I load a save state?</strong> <br />
While playing a game, tap the Menu button, then tap "Load State". Select the save state you want to load, and the game will resume from that point.</p>

<p><strong>Can I rename save states?</strong> <br />
Yes, in GBA4iOS 2.0 you can. While playing a game, tap the Menu button, then tap either "Save State" or "Load State". Now, tap and hold on any save (except for the Auto save), and a dialogue will pop up asking you if you want to rename the save state or protect/unprotect the save state. Tap "Rename Save State", enter the new name into the alert that appears, then tap "Rename".</p>

<p><strong>Can I protect save states from being overwritten by accident?</strong> <br />
Yes, in GBA4iOS 2.0 you can. While playing a game, tap the Menu button, then tap either "Save State" or "Load State". Now, tap and hold on any save (except for the Auto save), and a dialogue will pop up asking you if you want to rename the save state or protect/unprotect the save state. Tap "Protect Save State", and the save state will be moved into the Protected section. You cannot overwrite a protected save state, but you can still load it and delete it. If you want to unprotect a save state, tap and hold the protected save state, then tap "Unprotect Save State".</p>

<br />

<h2>Cheats (2.0 only)</h2>

<p><strong>How do I access the Cheats menu?</strong> <br />
While playing a game, tap the Menu button, then tap "Cheat Codes".</p>

<p><strong>How can I enable/disable cheats?</strong> <br />
From the Cheats menu, tap a cheat to toggle between it being enabled and disabled.</p>

<p><strong>How can I add new cheats?</strong> <br />
From the Cheats menu, tap Edit, then tap the plus button. A new cheat menu will appear, where you can name the cheat, select what type of cheat it is, and then finally type the cheat code itself.</p>

<p><strong>What types of cheats are supported?</strong> <br />
Game Boy Advance: GameShark v3, Action Replay, and Code Breaker.
Game Boy (Color): GameShark and Game Genie.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>Dropbox Sync (2.0 only)</h2>

<p><strong>How do I enable Dropbox Sync?</strong> <br />
From the main menu, tap the gear in the top left corner. Scroll down to "Dropbox Sync", then tap it to open up the Dropbox Sync menu. From here, you can toggle the switch at the top on, which will give you the option to sign into Dropbox. Sign in, and GBA4iOS will start syncing data to Dropbox.</p>

<p><strong>Why are all my games listed as "Conflicted" after turning on Dropbox Sync?</strong> <br />
This means a save file for this game already exists in Dropbox. Since GBA4iOS doesn't know which save file you'd prefer to use, it marks the game as conflicted and turns off syncing, so the correct save file isn't accidentally saved over.</p>

<p><strong>How can I un-conflict a game?</strong> <br />
From the Dropbox menu, tap the name of the conflicted game. From the new view that appears, you'll see the local save file for this game, as well as any that exist in Dropbox. Select either the local save file or one of the Dropbox save files to use on all your devices, then toggle the switch at the top on. This will sync the save file you selected to all your devices, and turn syncing back on for the game.</p>

<p><strong>Can I enable/disable Dropbox Syncing for individual games?</strong> <br />
Yes! From the Dropbox menu, tap the name of the game you want to enable/disable Dropbox Sync for, then toggle the switch at the top of the new view.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>Custom Controller Skins (2.0 only)</h2>

<p><strong>How can I change skins?</strong> <br />
From the main menu, tap the gear in the top left corner. Scroll down to the Controller Skins section, then tap either Game Boy Advance or Game Boy Color, depending on which skins you want to change. From the menu that appears, select either Portrait or Landscape, then tap the skin you want to use for the selected orientation.</p>

<p><strong>How can I add more skins?</strong> <br />
There are three ways to add skins to GBA4iOS:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>From the skin selection view, tap the plus button in the top right. A list of views will appear with previews of what they look like. Tap the skin you want, and it'll begin downloading to your device.  </p></li>
<li><p>Open Safari on your iOS device, and go to any GBA4iOS skins website (such as <a href="http://www.gba4ioskins.com">GBA4iOSkins.com</a>). Find the skin you want, and download it. Once it's downloaded, tap either "Open in GBA4iOS..." or "Open In..." then tap GBA4iOS, and it'll appear for you to select in the skin selection view.  </p></li>
<li><p>Download a .gbaskin or .gbcskin file from a GBA4iOS skin website on your computer. Open iTunes with your iOS device plugged in, then click on your device in the top right corner. Click "Apps" at the top of the screen, then scroll to down to the "File Sharing" section. Click GBA4iOS, then drag in the skin you want to use.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Can I change the controller skin opacity?</strong> <br />
Yes! From the main menu, tap the gear in the top left corner. Scroll down to Controller Opacity, and move the slider to change how transparent the skins are. (Skin has to support opacity for this to work.)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>Event Distribution (2.0 only)</h2>

<p><strong>How can I access Event Distributions?</strong> <br />
From time to time, I will enable certain events for Pokemon games, such as the ability to obtain an Aurora Ticket or receive a rare Pokemon. To check if there are any events currently available for your game, tap the Menu button, then tap "Event Distribution". A list of all current events will be displayed, and you can select which one you want to download and play.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a limited time period for these events?</strong> <br />
Depends on the event. When GBA4iOS 2.0 is released, I will simultaneously release an event for anyone with Pokemon Emerald to access. This event will always be available. However, other events such as distribution of the Aurora Ticket will only be available for a limited time.</p>

<p><strong>How will I know if there's a new event?</strong> <br />
If you want to make sure you don't miss any events, you can follow me on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/rileytestut">@rileytestut</a>), as I'll post about all events there.</p>

<p><strong>Does Event Distribution use cheat codes to unlock features?</strong> <br />
Nope!</p>
